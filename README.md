# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is an assigned project for The Odin Project that I have now successfully completed. In this
project I have demonstrated how to make hyperlinks, add images, and basic formatting skills when making
the web pages for this basic website. The formatting skills included, but weren't limited to:  making
lists, adding headings and creating partial structured paragraphs.

As a note, it is quite obvious I was having a spot of fun making my preparation instructions in the
hard shell tacos page!
