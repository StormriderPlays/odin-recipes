        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard Shell Tacos (brand does not matter)</li>
            <li>Ground Beef (1 lbs. or more recommended)</li>
            <li>Taco Seasoning (brand does not matter)</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese</li>
            <li>Lettuce (pre-shredded or hand-cut is fine)</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Onions (optional)</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven dictated by instructions on taco shell box. Layout shells evenly across flat cookie sheet in preparation for their eventual smelting process.</li>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a large pot on the stove top and set heat to high. Separate and mix the beef in the pot until all pink is deleted from existance.</li>
            <li>While beef is cooking, hand cut any lettuce, tomatoes or onions you are going to include in the sacrificial meal to your stomach.</li>
            <li>Once beef is cooked, pour the contents of the pot into a strainer and collect the grease to be thrown into the wastebin of disease.</li>
            <li>By this time the oven should be finished flaming the souls of the damned; take the sheet of hard shells and place it into the oven for the designated time stated on the box.</li>
            <li>After beef is drained of its fattening juices of delight, place the beef back into the pot and add the taco seasoning as directed on the back of packet and leave to simmer, mixing occasionally.</li>
            <li>Collect all remaining ingredients that didn't need to be prepared and let the taco shells out of their fiery hell to cool off.</li>
            <li>You now have some bomb-a** tacos. Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
